        <h1>Facts About Hazelnuts!</h1>
        <p>Did you know that Hazelnuts are, in fact, NOT Macademia nuts? Actually, here's a list of things that Hazelnuts are not.</p>
        <ul>Hazelnuts are NOT:
            <li id="shw" onmouseover="more()">Macademia nuts.</li>
            <li>Chestnuts.</li>
            <li>Made of chocolate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hazelnuts, also, can be made into a chocolate spread, but this does not mean that this spread is automatically good for you!</p>
