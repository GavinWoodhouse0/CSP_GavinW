        <h1>One Quarter of the Four Corners National Monument</h1>
        <p>The Four Corners National Monument is a celebration of the unity of the United States; four of them, at least. This is a place where you take in Navajo and Ute culture, a place where you celebrate the unity displayed by the only quadrapoint in the US, and it is a place where you splay yourself on the ground so you post on FaceBook about how you were in all four states at once. Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona; these are more than just the 2nd through 5th most square states, nor are they just the states with the best flags in my opinion, these are the states that make up the Four Corners. We only care about Utah though, so let's discuss what you'd find in that states corner.</p>
        <ul>In Utah's corner you would find:
            <li>The seal and (hopefully redesigned) flag of Utah.</li>
            <li>Benches.</li>
            <li>Navajo Vendors, who sell jewlery and traditional foods.</li>
            <li>The words "FOUR STATES" on the granite plaque.</li>
            <li>The original, incorrect monument.</li>
            <li>A Trading Post around 30 miles away.</li>
        </ul>
